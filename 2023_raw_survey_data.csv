When I realized I didn’t have a chance to be in the top ten, I didn’t try anymore, and that was only after a week or so. There’s just no chance to make up hundreds of thousands of steps. But I could have passed the person in front of me, maybe even three people in front of me. Seeing the people right in front of me might have made me do a quick after-dinner stroll. Attainable goals (even without prizes) are more of a motivator for me. I also would have liked to have seen what my ranking was out of the whole program. Okay so I’m #44, but is that out of 45 total, or out of 200, or 5,000? It makes a difference in my motivation level. And I don’t know if people actually passed me or if more people just joined the program and their data got added from their phones. Perhaps have age categories too, or something to make it so you’re not competing with everyone in the whole program. Like instead of the top ten total, do the top 2 from each of 5 different age categories. "
