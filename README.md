# IWALK Contest Data Analysis

This repo contains the data analysis of the 2023 IWalk Contest. The raw data are deindentified survey responses administered post-contest and deidentified step data downloaded from the app.
First, we impute missing step data by analyzing the performance of two methods of imputation - mean and median imputation. Then we create a new dataset with imputed steps to analyze the difference in average number of steps walked pre and post contest. 
The survey data is used to analyze health behaviors, lifestyle changes, demographics as well as get qualitative feedback on users' experience of the app.
